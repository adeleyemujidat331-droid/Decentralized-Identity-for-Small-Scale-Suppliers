# 🆔 Decentralized Identity for Small-Scale Suppliers

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 solution empowering small-scale suppliers with verifiable digital identities on the Stacks blockchain! This project addresses the real-world problem of limited market access for artisans, farmers, and micro-entrepreneurs who lack formal documentation. By leveraging decentralized identity (DID), suppliers can prove their legitimacy, build trust, and unlock opportunities in global supply chains without relying on centralized authorities.

Built with Clarity smart contracts on Stacks, this system ensures immutability, privacy, and scalability while involving 8 modular smart contracts for robust functionality.

## ✨ Features

🆔 **Self-Sovereign Identity Creation**: Suppliers register a unique DID with basic profile data and optional biometric hashes for proof-of-personhood.
🔍 **Credential Issuance & Verification**: Trusted issuers (e.g., local cooperatives) mint verifiable credentials like production certifications or quality stamps.
📊 **Supplier Profile Management**: Update and showcase profiles with transaction history, ratings, and linked assets.
🏪 **Market Access Gateway**: Apply for listings on decentralized marketplaces, with automated approval based on verified credentials.
💰 **Incentive Token System**: Earn and stake tokens for maintaining good standing and participating in governance.
⚖️ **Dispute Resolution Mechanism**: Escalate and resolve conflicts via community-voted arbitration.
🔒 **Privacy-Preserving Queries**: Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification without revealing sensitive data.
📈 **Analytics Dashboard**: Query aggregate data for market insights (anonymized for privacy).

## 🛠 How It Works

This project solves the barrier of unverified identities for small-scale suppliers by creating a tamper-proof, blockchain-based system. Suppliers gain access to larger markets, fair pricing, and financing options, reducing exploitation by intermediaries. The system uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to handle identity lifecycle, verification, and integration.

### For Suppliers (e.g., Small Farmers or Artisans)

- Generate a DID hash from your details (name, location, proof-of-work like a photo hash).
- Call `register-identity` on IdentityRegistry to create your profile.
- Partner with issuers to get credentials (e.g., quality certification) via CredentialIssuer.
- Update your profile on SupplierProfile and apply for markets using MarketAccess.
- Earn tokens through verified sales and use them to boost visibility.

Boom! You're now verifiable and accessible to global buyers.

### For Verifiers & Marketplaces

- Use CredentialVerifier to instantly check a supplier's credentials without accessing private data.
- Query SupplierProfile for ratings and history.
- Integrate MarketAccess for seamless onboarding—approve applications based on DID proofs.
- Resolve any issues via DisputeResolver for trust maintenance.

### For Issuers (e.g., Local Cooperatives)

- Register as an issuer on CredentialIssuer.
- Mint credentials for verified suppliers using `issue-credential`.
- Monitor usage through on-chain events.

That's it! Decentralized, secure, and inclusive market access for all.
